## Dispatcher Coding Challenge II

### Task

The goal is to code an HTML + JavaScript snippet which augments an input field with auto suggestions based on the text input. Suggestions should come from Google Maps's [PlacesService](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#TextSearchRequests) and list places around San Francisco.

### 3rd party libraries

Feel free to use any _supporting_ 3rd party libraries (jQuery, Angular, React etc.), as long as they don't cover already the entire use case. The part which augments the input field and queries the PlacesService should be your own implementation.

### Deliverable

A link to a jsfiddle (or equivalent) that demonstrates your implementation.
